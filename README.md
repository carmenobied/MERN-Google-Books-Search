React Google Books Search App

![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to create a new React-based Google Books Search app. On the frontend, this involved creating React components, working with helper/util functions, and utilizing React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. On the server side, it also involved using Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## User Story
```
As a user, I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once,
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.
```

```
i. Fork the Github repository.
ii. Clone the forked repo into your local machine using gitbash/terminal to pull the project and data.
iii. Run the command-lines to run the app functionality. You can also access the files and assets via Visual Studio to view the code.

```
## Usage
```
Technologies Used:
MERN - MongoDB - Express - React - Node - axios - ReactDOM.render - components - state - props - classes - hooks - socket.io
```
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
